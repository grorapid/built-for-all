# Overview

Grorapid  - ***Built for all*** is a collection of tools, scripts and projects which Grorapid engineering team and other contributors work together to make software meaningful and useful. We work on both small and large projects to make sure contributors can understand the nuances of Building, Maintaining and scaling as per the interests.
It can include some tools and scripts built by others and reused or reorganised to give a different positioning.
